Bot is setup to allow @everyone to only use !serwer, if you want to make people be able to use more commands change dev:true to false in command file
also, if you want only few people to use a command just add their user id into devs.json
Feel free to edit the code, edited code isnt supported by me thought.
In case of bugs ect. open an issue or contact me on discord or Demon. He knows more about code than me.
